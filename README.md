## 🔥 Quick highlights (TL;DR)
- **Goal:** Discover team playing-style archetypes using unsupervised learning and measure which styles win titles.
- **Approach:** Aggregate match stats per team → Standardize → PCA for visualization → K-Means for clustering → correlate clusters with champions.
- **Key finding:** “Offensive Titans” and “Balanced Competitors” produce the most championships in our sample; pure defensive strategies are less likely to win.
- **Deliverable:** `refined_report.pdf` — polished, multi-page report with visuals and recommendations.
